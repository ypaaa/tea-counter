# Testnet Counter App

A simple decentralized application (dApp) built with Next.js that interacts with a counter smart contract on the Testnet.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic integration between a web application and the blockchain. It features a smart contract that maintains a counter which can only be incremented, showcasing fundamental blockchain interactions like:
- Smart contract deployment
- Wallet connection
- Transaction signing
- Event listening
- State updates

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MetaMask browser extension
- TEA for gas fees (get from the faucet)
- A code editor (VS Code or Cursor recommended)

## Smart Contract Details

The Counter smart contract (`contracts/src/Counter.sol`) implements:
- A private counter variable
- An increment function that adds 1 to the counter
- A getter function to read the current count
- An event emission after each increment

The current Counter contract is deployed to the testnet at address `0xf68BF793ca197FF68A05118f1b2FA647dd03b86C`. 
See the code below for the contract's source code.

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Counter {
    uint256 private count;
    
    event CountIncremented(uint256 newCount);
    
    function increment() public {
        count += 1;
        emit CountIncremented(count);
    }
    
    function getCount() public view returns (uint256) {
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd your-repo
npm install
```

2. Deploy the smart contract:
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network tea-sepolia
```

3. Configure the frontend:
Configure the frontend to use the deployed contract address.

Modify the `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` file to use the deployed contract address:

```typescript
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'your_deployed_contract_address' // You'll need to update this after deploying
```

1. Start the NextJS development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Using the dApp

1. Connect Your Wallet:
   - Ensure MetaMask is installed
   - Switch to the testnet network
   - Click "Connect Wallet" in the dApp
   - Approve the connection in MetaMask

2. Interact with the Counter:
   - View the current count
   - Click "Increment Counter" to increase the value
   - Confirm the transaction in MetaMask
   - Wait for transaction confirmation
   - See the updated count

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js 13+ (React framework)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ethers.js for blockchain interaction
- web3modal for wallet connection

### Blockchain
- Network: tea-sepolia
- Smart Contract Language: Solidity ^0.8.0
- Contract Framework: Hardhat
- Contract Interaction: ethers.js
